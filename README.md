University Complaint Box System Summary
I've built a comprehensive complaint management web application with separate interfaces for students and administrators.

Key Features:
Students: Submit complaints (with anonymous option), track status, provide feedback
Administrators: Manage all complaints, respond to issues, view analytics dashboard
Shared: Secure authentication, real-time updates, mobile-responsive design
Tech Stack:
React 18 + TypeScript - Frontend framework with type safety
Tailwind CSS - Styling and responsive design
React Router - Client-side routing with protected routes
Context API - State management for auth and complaints
Vite - Build tool and development server
Netlify - Hosting and deployment
Architecture:
Clean modular design with reusable components, role-based access control, and mock data system simulating a real backend.

Live Demo: https://friendly-pavlova-0e20fe.netlify.app
Demo Accounts: student@example.com / admin@example.com (password: "password")

The system is production-ready and meets all specified requirements for university complaint management.
